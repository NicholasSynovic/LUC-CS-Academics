Artificial Intelligence
======================================================

(MS in Computer Science)

Students interested in AI require a broad range of skills including elements of data science and basic data analysis, but also a demonstrable ability to apply those skills in advanced projects with integrated, intelligent systems. The following courses are important to establish these skills, and an independent study opportunity or significant extra-curricular project effort is suggested as a portfolio item indicating the ability to integrate the necessary data analysis and CS skills.
