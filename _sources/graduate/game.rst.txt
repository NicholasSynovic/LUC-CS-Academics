Video Game Developer
======================

(MS in Software Engineering)

Game design and development continues to evolve and grow, now encompassing media,
engineering, design, and many related facets of hardware and software development.
Designing, developing, and publishing a competitive game requires a broad
understanding and clear appreciation of software engineering. Performance,
optimization, and clear design are critical features of a successful game,
in particular for mobile platforms. Gaming continues to explore new options
for design and development, including
mobile, cloud, machine learning, AI, VR, and recent options for AR.

As a video game designer and developer,
there are many opportunities to directly apply abstract concepts in a fun, entertaining environment.
Itâ€™s a lot of work, but also a lot of fun!
