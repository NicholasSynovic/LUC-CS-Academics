Project Manager
=================

(MS Information Technology)

Most software development, as well as the development of marketing campaigns, new products, business process reengineering, diversity initiatives and many other organizational endeavors are not ongoing business processes, but rather projects.  Projects have well defined time, scope and cost constraints.  There are accepted techniques and standards for managing a project through its five phases.  A good project manager must be adept at eliciting business requirements, managing people and teams, identifying risks, and estimating activity costs and times.
