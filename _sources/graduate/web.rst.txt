Web Developer / User Experience Designer
==========================================

(MS in Software Engineering)

Web design and development encompasses many disparate technologies, concepts, and patterns.
Beyond an initial consideration of HTML and CSS, engineering a modern web app, site,
and cloud infrastructure requires a clear appreciation and understanding of the myriad options
for modern web development.
UI and UX design also play a key role in creating an appealing and engaging web application.

JavaScript has now become a core technology for full-stack web applications,
from client-side to server-side, and complementary middleware options.
Its usage is evolving rapidly,
offering myriad opportunities for a software engineer and designer alike.

Itâ€™s a fun, direct application of software engineering design and practices,
providing clear, discernible skills for prospective job seekers.
